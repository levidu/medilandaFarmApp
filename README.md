# medilandaFarmApp

This is an automatic data-entry system to a food production facility in Sri Lanka. It runs hand in hand with a Raspberry Pi3 which runs a python script every time a function is pressed. Users can enter the relevant data such as the egg count, the damage egg count, etc. and place the RFID card to the reader that is attached to the RPi3. This would use selenium to automatically read all the information in the RFID card and fill the form automatically.

Play! framework is using to code the web app.
